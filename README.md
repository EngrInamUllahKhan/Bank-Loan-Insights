**Problem Statement:** Advanced Dashboard Development for Loan Data Analysis. The current approach to loan data analysis lacks depth and interactivity, hindering the ability to derive meaningful insights for informed decision-making. Traditional reporting methods fall short in providing a comprehensive view of lending operations, borrower behavior, and loan performance metrics. There is a pressing need for advanced dashboard design to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of our loan data.

**Objective:** Our objective is to craft a suite of interconnected dashboards that deliver dynamic and comprehensive insights into our loan data, empowering decision-makers with actionable intelligence derived from robust data analysis. These dashboards are meticulously designed to offer a holistic perspective on our lending operations, borrower demographics, loan performance, and financial metrics, facilitating strategic decision-making based on data-driven insights.
